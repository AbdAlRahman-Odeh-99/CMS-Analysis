Error in rule prepareCommand:
    jobid: 2
    output: /home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis/vol/code/commands.sh
    shell:
        
        
        docker run         --name ubuntu         --mount type=bind,source=/home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis,target=/home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis         ubuntu:latest         bash /home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis/shell-scripts/Bash/prepare-bash.sh /home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis/vol &&         docker stop ubuntu &&         docker rm ubuntu
        
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job prepareCommand since they might be corrupted:
/home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis/vol/code/commands.sh
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
