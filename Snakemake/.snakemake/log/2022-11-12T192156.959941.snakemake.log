ImproperOutputException in line 195 of /home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis/Snakefile:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule prepareCommand:

Removing output files of failed job prepareCommand since they might be corrupted:
/home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis/vol/code, /home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis/vol/data, /home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis/vol/nevents, /home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis/vol/output
Skipped removing non-empty directory /home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/CMS-Analysis/vol/code
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
